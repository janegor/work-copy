									<h2>The Challenge</h2>
									<p style="font-style:oblique;">"Over 600,000 individuals are released from prison annually and three-quarters of them are rearrested within five years of their release (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005). Men and women released from correctional facilities receive minimal preparation and inadequate assistance and resources, which makes their re-entry into communities challenging (Visher & Mallik-Kane, 2007). A criminal conviction limits employment prospects, public housing assistance and social services (Coates, 2015). Even having a minor criminal record creates substantial barriers and far-reaching collateral consequences. It is important to transform the current criminal justice system to shift the focus from reincarceration to successful re-entry into their communities. Socioeconomic factors play an important role in determining successful re-entry outcomes." <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/indicator/2018/03/prisons-to-communities">- The American Psychological Association</a></p>
									<p>The reentry process is not an easy one. This was made clear both through our outside research and through a meeting with our partner organization, The Criminal Justice Ministry (CJM). My New Member Educators worked with CJM to put together this question for my first design project as a member of Design For America.</p>
									<div class="indent-style" style="margin-left:5%">
										<h4 style=" border-left:5px solid black; padding:10px;">How might we work to increase the independence and stability
											of those reentrying society from periods of incarceration??</h4>
									</div>
								</div>

								<div class="row">
									<h2>The Partner</h2>
									<p>The Criminal Justice Ministry (CJM) has been serving St. Louis communities since 1979. It provides
										services to incarcerated individuals and facilitates reentry programs while seeking
										"to serve and not to judge." We were fortunate enough to partner with this organization and interview
										members of its Release to Rent Housing Program.</p>

								</div>

								<div class="row">
									<h2>The Solution</h2>
									<p>After numerous interviews led us back to the structure of a popular resource guide,
										our team proposed a redesigned template. It would help users identify their specific needs
										and direct them towards the ideal St. Louis resources. Below is our first round of prototypes for the project.
										Unfortunately, the project was never fully implemented - more on this can be found under ROADBLOCKS.</p>

								<div class="row">
									<h2>Initial Research</h2>
									<p>In addition to secondary research, our team ran two rounds of interviews with members of CJM's Rent to Release Housing Program.
									All 10 of the individuals we spoke with had been incarcerated for a period of at least 10 years and had varying release dates.
									Participation in our interviews was an optional activity after a required group therapy session the participants attended weekly.

								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<h2>Synthesis</h2>
									<p>After debriefing the interviews and putting all our observations and notes onto sticky notes, we began grouping them into categories as part
									of the sythesis step in the process. Patterns began to emerge, with the period directly before release emerging as a major pain point. Through this process, we realized the resource guide
									"Start Here STL" was mentioned in almost every interview.</p>

												<figcaption>Start Here STL Booklet inside</figcaption>
											</figure>
										</div>
									</div>

									<p>As we began collecting insights, my team developed a user persona focused on the period prior to release. This was used as a reference
										for the rest of the project. </p>
									<img class="img-responsive project-img" src="images/persona.jpg" alt="User Persona">
								</div>

								<div class="row">
									<h2>Interview Insights</h2>
									<p>After sythesis, my team narrowed down our insights to the three we wanted to focus on. Each insight led to a variation of our original "how might we" question.</p>
									<h4>
										<ol>
											<li>
												<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px;">St. Louis' current most-used resource guide is overwhelming, and at times, incorrect. </h4>
												<h4 style="font-style:oblique;">How might we most efficiently present accurate information on resources for those seeking reentry?</h4>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Certain attributes (nature of offense, family relationships, money) can disqualify individuals from accessing resources.</h4>
												<h4 style="font-style:oblique;">How might we access and provide the most pertinent information to the diverse set of individuals seeking reentry?</h4>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Technology is a major barrier to resources, both with its restriction in prisons and learning curve after reentry. </h4>
												<h4 style="font-style:oblique;">How might we publish information on reentry resources in a way that minimizes barriers to access?</h4>
											</li>
										</ol>
									</h4>
									<p>With these insights, our team took a step back to update our project goal.</p>
									<div class="indent-style" style="margin-left:5%">
										<h4 style=" border-left:5px solid black; padding:10px;">How might we most efficiently connect a diverse population of currently incarcerated individuals with the specific information they need to successfully begin their reentry process?</h4>
									</div>
								</div>

								<div class="row">
									<h2>Ideation</h2>
									<p>With this new question in mind, our team started ideating. We had a large range of ideas but ultimately decided on creating an updated and easy to navigate resource guide.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="row">
										<h2>Prototype</h2>
										<p>I mocked up sample pages for the proposed guide so we could recieve feedback on the idea during our testing session with CJM. </p>
								</div>

								<div class="row">
										<h2>Roadblocks</h2>
										<p>Ultimately, this project was never implemented. After prototyping the pages and recieving positive feedback, we began working through the logisitics of putting the guide together.
										Start Here STL was not interested in partnering with us and so, as a team of five students, we were faced with 520 organizations to research and input into our guide. In addition to
										our classwork, this simply wasn't feasible.
										However, the project's failure taught my team two important lessons that I now emphasize in the early stages of all my design projects.</p>
										<h4>
											<ol>
												<li>
													<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px;">The importance of evaluating feasability vs. impact</h4>
													<h4 style="font-style:oblique;">explanation</h4>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Considering sustainability</h4>
													<h4 style="font-style:oblique;">How might we access and provide the most pertinent information to the diverse set of individuals seeking reentry?</h4>
												</li>
											</ol>
										</h4>
